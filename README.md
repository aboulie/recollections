# Recollections

Recollections is a way to commemorate and honor loved ones who have passed on. Recollections gives you a way to create memories that will be everlasting by giving a user ways to create Tribute pages with which friends, family, and loved ones can contribute to. Loved ones can reminisce together over memories. Family members will be able to create and edit comments, stories, photo albums, and all the details loved ones want to share and remember with others.
